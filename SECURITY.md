# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The most recent last two major releases after v0.x.x

So for example: v1.x.x and v2.x.x

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Always report a vulnerability or security issue privately**

1. Go to the repository at https://github.com/mvdkleijn/healthchecker/security (security tab/section)
2. Click the green "Report vulnerability" button at the top right

Reports will be validated and published when found credible, together with any temporary mitigations or advised upgrade path and original reporter name (if desired).

Security related issues made in the **public** issue tracker **will be hidden or removed**! Please never do this as it creates unneeded overhead.
