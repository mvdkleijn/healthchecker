# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The most recent last two major releases after v0.x.x

So for example: v1.x.x and v2.x.x

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use the security tab in the repository at https://github.com/mvdkleijn/healthchecker/security to **privately** report security related issues.

Reports will be validated and published when found credible, together with any temporary mitigations or advised upgrade path and original reporter name (if desired).

Security related issues made in the **public** issue tracker **will be hidden or removed**! So please don't do this.
